# Here is some additional information about me!

## Where am I From?

I'm from a town of around 25,000 people in Colorado called Golden. I've lived there almost my entire life. For reference, its about 30 min west of Denver, and about 20 min south of Boulder. I was extremely lucky to grow up there. Fun fact: it's the home town of Coors Beer!

## What do I like to do?

I love anything that involves being outside. Some of my hobbies include hiking, skiing, and rock climbing! I also just enjoy being active in general, as I spent a lot of my free time at the gym and doing yoga. Additionally, I love spending time with my friends, travelling, and cooking! 

**One of my favorite ski resorts is Arapahoe Basin**
