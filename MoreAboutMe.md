# Here is some additional information about me!

## Where am I From?

I'm from a town of around 25,000 people in Colorado called Golden. I've lived there almost my entire life. For reference, its about 30 min west of Denver, and about 20 min south of Boulder. I was extremely lucky to grow up there. Fun fact: it's the home town of Coors Beer! 

**This is Golden**
